# BigSys

A discord bot that can play music from YouTube, search on Wikipedia and other basic functions all with a voice assistant mode.

## Name

BigSys stands for Big System. It is also a play of word as it sounds like Big Sis. This name is also a reference to Big Brother in 1984 by George Orwell.

This bot is quite computationally heavy as it uses 5 machine learning models when all functionallities are bootstraped.
